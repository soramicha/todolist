# *Todo List*

#### *Video Demo:*  https://youtu.be/BHm54k3SZUw
#### *Description:* This is a command line program I made using C and SQL.

#### *What is the project:*
##### Just like the title of this file, I decided to make a todo list. It's to help improve time managament.

#### *Why I decided to make it:*
##### Making my own todo list was a goal of mine's. I love having lists of tasks in front of me so everything is organized. But it's always cooler if I know a program that I use is something that I created, and so for this final project, I wanted to make my own todo list.

#### *Design choices and breakdown of the main functions:*
##### There are a total of five different functions at the moment:

##### - *Add:* adding a task (command: todo add)
##### - *Delete:* deleting a task (command: todo del)
##### - *Editing Status:* editing the complete/incomplete status of a task (command: todo estatus)
##### - *Editing Task:* editing a task (command: todo etask)
##### - *See:* viewing all current tasks (command: todo see)

##### I decided to list each task with their ID and status.

#### *Overall Summary/Challenges Faced:*
##### I started making this on November 11, 2022. It took me less than a month to create this program. I have procrastinated quite a bit throughout this coding journey, mainly because I was stuck on trying to make C and SQL work together. My dad gave me a few tips on where to start and I was able to improve little by little. Online, I found a very useful article about the combination of C and SQL, and the types of commands necessary to make them work together. I took a while reading through and it was confusing at first, but my dad taught me to be more careful by reading step by step. Slowly, I was able to grasp the concept and I was able to make my add function work. Afterwards, I continued to quickly make the rest of the four functions work. Finally, on December 1st, I finished making my simple todo list program.

#### *Future Improvement:*
##### I hope to use this program for myself, and with that being said, there are a lot of things I would want to do. I want to change the formatting of the table to make it look more organized, and add some color on text if I can. I also want to add more functions, such as sorting all tasks that are complete or incomplete. I also want to further hopefully expand this into an actual app or make a website version of the todo list.

#### Personal Note:
##### Overall, the CS50 course was a very eyeopening and educational experience for me. I enjoyed it a lot, and I was introduced to so many new things. I enjoyed learning languages the most.
